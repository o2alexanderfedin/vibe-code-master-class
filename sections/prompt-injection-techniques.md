# üéØ Prompt Injection Techniques for Guided AI Development

## Understanding Prompt Injection

Prompt injection is a technique where you strategically include guidance, hints, or context within your prompts to subtly direct the AI's next steps. Unlike traditional prompting, which focuses on the immediate request, injection techniques plant seeds for future interactions and help maintain consistency throughout a development session.

## üß≠ Types of Injections for Vibe Coding

### 1. Path Indicators
```
Can you implement this feature? (After this, we'll need to write tests and update documentation)
```
This subtly prepares the AI for the expected workflow, making transitions between tasks smoother.

### 2. Context Breadcrumbs
```
As we discussed earlier when implementing the authentication module (which used JWT and required refresh tokens), now we need to add user profile functionality.
```
These remind the AI of previous context that might be relevant to the current task.

### 3. Expectation Setters
```
Create a React component for user profiles. I expect you'll use hooks and follow our established pattern of separating logic from presentation.
```
These guide the AI toward your preferred implementation approach without micromanaging.

### 4. Future-Step Hints
```
Let's implement the data layer now, keeping in mind we'll eventually need to handle offline synchronization.
```
This plants seeds for considerations that will become important in future development steps.

## üß† Why Injection Works

AI models like Claude have limited context windows and can't always maintain perfect awareness of the entire development process. Prompt injections serve as guideposts that help the AI:

1. Maintain consistency across multiple interactions
2. Prepare for upcoming requirements
3. Make decisions aligned with the overall project direction
4. Reduce the need for extensive corrections later

## üìù Crafting Effective Injections

The most effective prompt injections are:

### Subtle but Clear
Too heavy-handed, and you're just giving direct instructions. Too subtle, and the AI might miss the hint.

### Contextually Relevant
Injections should feel like natural parts of the conversation or task description.

### Forward-Looking
The best injections set up success for future interactions, not just the current one.

### Layered
Build a mental model in the AI over time through consistent, reinforcing injections.

## üö´ Avoiding Manipulation

It's important to distinguish between helpful guidance and attempting to manipulate the AI:

- Good: Providing context and direction that helps the AI better serve your needs
- Bad: Trying to trick the AI into bypassing its safety guidelines or generating inappropriate content

## üîÑ Creating Continuous Improvement Loops

One of the most powerful applications of prompt injection is establishing feedback loops:

```
This implementation looks good. Let's review it against our requirements to see if we've missed anything. (Later, we'll use this same review process for all our features)
```

This not only helps with the current task but establishes a pattern of quality control that the AI will begin to incorporate into its workflow automatically.

## üåü Examples from Real Projects

### Example 1: Setting up a branching pattern
```
Let's create a new feature branch for this. (Remember we use the pattern feature/descriptive-name and always branch from develop)
```

### Example 2: Maintaining architectural consistency
```
We need to add a new API endpoint. As we've done with the other endpoints, this should follow our REST conventions and include proper error handling.
```

### Example 3: Gradual introduction of complexity
```
Let's start with a basic implementation that handles the happy path. (Later we'll add error handling and edge cases)
```

By mastering prompt injection techniques, you can create a more coherent, efficient development experience with AI assistance, reducing the cognitive overhead of constantly having to reestablish context and expectations.
